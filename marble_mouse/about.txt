I have this same Logitech Trackman Marble. I used the following configuration in F23 and am 
actually using the same in F24. I create a file, e. g. 50-marblemouse.conf in 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf and put a file with the following content in it:

Code:
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier  "Marble Mouse"
        MatchProduct "Logitech USB Trackball"
        MatchIsPointer "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "evdev"
        Option "ButtonMapping" "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
        Option "EmulateWheel" "true"
        Option "EmulateWheelButton" "8"
        Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
        Option "XAxisMapping" "6 7"
        Option "Emulate3Buttons" "true"
        Option "EmulateWheelInertia" "10"            # Factory default: 50
EndSection
This configuration enables scrolling with the big red ball while the left small button is 
pressed. The button usually has the browser-back function. If you press and release the button 
quickly, it performs the back function. If you press and hold the button, you are able to 
scroll horizontally and vertically.

Thanks for this awesome solution CSchwangler!

Used for Logitech Marble Mouse.
